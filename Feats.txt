----- PUZZLE:

o NEWS: THE MAIN MODE
IS NOW BASED ON HOW MANY
BLOCKS YOU CAN EXPLODE AT
ONCE, combos will still
be counted but they will 
no longer be the main obj.

o Build up meteorites and 
send them off.

o Being able to play team
battles and giving each 
other lives and powerups.

o People on your team can
tell you thru voice chat
what's going on, as 
other players can turn the 
lights off for example.

Or maybe that there's a
flash of a powerup inside
a block that another player
sees, and can tell that 
player of which one it is.

o (LATER) Add a 2d puzzle
solving mode (multiplayer), 
with side scrolling,
Time limit to solve the puzzles.
multiple teams, consisting
of atleast 2 but not more than
4, puzzles will custom to the
amount of players in. For ex:
if there's 3 players, then
they will only encounter general
(like word puzzles, logical riddles,
etc.), or 3 player puzzles.

o The boxer can destroy blocks
in place, literally blow them up
but will not gain full points
for it, thus still incentivizing
skillful play

o Be able to send meteorites
to another player of your choosing.

o Add a Simon says mode instead
of the falling blocks shit

o Box can:

	- slide blocks horiz.
	- delete them by punching
	them (minimal points).
	- make columns slide 
	to back. (column punch)

o Boxer has a pound that leaves
him with only a certain color
after finish (ex: performed
over blue block will leave him
with only blues underneath).

o (LATER) Add a blind-man mode, 
essentially you have to
guide your friend, you
can see all the blocks
but he can't, he can
only see his player.

This mode is in teams, 
the one with the most
combo's after a time 
limit wins.

If your homie gets 
enough combos or
something you get
to drop blocks that
would be favorable
to his current block
layout/situation.
