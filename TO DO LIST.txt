o Create the main menu.

o Add a megaman style explode animation
to the character when something fell on him.

o Add the animations

o Imp. column upper - NEXT (1).

o Have the objective of the game be to 
get the highest block chain. There are
2 main conditions in this game:

	- Getting the longest block
	chain automatically puts you
	in the lead.

	- But, Ultimately the person
	with the highest score
	wins. You can increase
	your score by getting matches
	and combo's. As for chains,
	they work on a multiplier, 
	of which the formula is:

	(how_many_blocks * .25)^5 = how many points you earn.

	//so for example:
		//16 blocks
		(16 * .25)^5 = 1024;

o Tables the DB will have:

	- Simon_LB

	- Solo_LB (this is the game mode we have
	now)

o The DB user table will have:
	
	- room address. This is the current 
	room you're in, this will be used for:
		
		o determining how many people
		are in a room (helps with limit).

		o help other players pool the 
		players in a room and randomly
		pick someone to send to.
	
	
	- username 

	- password

	- How many meteors you have
	coming at you.

	- online state, string that
	has states like "running", 
	"waiting", "offline", etc.

	- How many games you've won.

o ONLINE:

	- Use the master OBJ we have and make
	it persist, have it keep the username
	inside it.

	- make it so the only way the game will
	accept your username is if:

		1. Your not auth. already.
		2. You type in the right password.
		(use bcrypt)

	- In order to create new rooms return
	an array of online users, go down to
	the last one, take the room number of the 
	last user, try to splice 20 users
	back in the array, and if the number you
	took is 16 create a new room, if not assign
	the user the number.
