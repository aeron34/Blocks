o Have the objective of the game be to 
get the highest block chain. There are
2 main conditions in this game:

	- Getting the longest block
	chain automatically puts you
	in the lead.

	- But, Ultimately the person
	with the highest score
	wins. You can increase
	your score by getting matches
	and combo's. As for chains,
	they work on a multiplier, 
	of which the formula is:

	(how_many_blocks * .25)^5 = how many points you earn.

	//so for example:
		//16 blocks
		(16 * .25)^5 = 1024;

of simp., for every 1000 points
10 cents is taken off.
