o Implement block falling
system:

	- Create an array of
	X points, as all blocks
	will have the same 
	Y.
	
	- Give blocks random
	spawn times.

	- Make it so if block
	falls on head of player,
	heart is lost.

o Implement heart/lives system:

	- Get an Image for the hearts

	- Anchor in top left with canvas.

o Implement block swap system.

o Create the main menu.

o When blocks fall, until they're
touched by player they are in
locked mode (x position is frozen).

o Implement auto snap feat on
blocks, basically they gravitate
horizon. to the closest block:
	
	- block below's lock_x
	bool has to be true
	
	- if two blocks below
	have the same distance
	from said block's center,
	randomly pick between
	the 2.

o Add Top bar on UI to show which
blocks are about to fall in advance:

	- use a queue style
	linked list, popping
	from the front, after	
	said block falls.


END X: -20.3
MAX X: 20.3

Create an array of 
20 float containing
the X values, each
value differing by 2.
