o Add a megaman style explode animation
to the character when something fell on him.

o Add the animations - NEXT(1)

o Set up google Ads.

o Introduce level up system (AFTER LAUNCH)

o Sometime in the future update the site and add:

	o Option to upload profile pic.

	o Add news column

	o Add a profile section that allows
	you to see your wins/losses.


o Edit the Back to character select:

	1. change the text to back to 
	game modes	

	2. change the image

o Make it so that the when the column
reaches a certain number, the column
deletes it's blocks, restaring (AFTER LAUNCH AND 500+ Steady Player Base).


o To fix last man standing, give it a countdown
of 10 mins, and if you're both still alive
then highest score wins.


---------------- (LATER, AFTER RELEASE) --------------------

o create a dictionary object, initially
set it as empty. this will be a dict that
tracks how many blocks are touching each other, for ex:
{red: 4, //this means 4 reds are touching in the column
blue: 0,
etc...}

And only renew/update with new values this object when a 
function (UP_Dict maybe) is called by a block that was destroyed
in that column. The freshly updated version will now be 
used as a pre-state of sorts, and make the blocks no longer
have the time window float for touching after a detonation, 
have the column handle it by setting self check on its blocks
to true if the state has change from previous, so for example:
after a blow up, the state has yellows touching as 0 ({yell: 0...})
but after a few seconds, 2 yellows touch ({yell: 2}), now this
will trigger the column to call check() on the designated blocks (think
of the for loop that looks for blocks above the exploded one, this
is an array of those above blocks)

o Add puzzle creator mode.

o Create a Random Controller Obj that automates actions
of fake players as if they were real, this gives
the feel of a community (NEXT [3]):

	- Automate score increases, since the 
	game requests the scores of other players
	from the RoomManager, we can just change
	that directly. To create this function
	just pick a random fake name in the room
	and increase it's score by a random number. 
	When you do this also send a random number (1 - 5)
	of meteors.

	- If the room is full of fakes, dead it.

	- Randomly pick a fake name/user and add it 
	to rooms, 

	- EDIT the send meteors code to make it always
	res.send "done"(because send met. will keep trying
	if fails)

o Implement quick jab for box. It's the one 
that reshuffles the order of the blocks. 
we can achieve this by setting up 2 raycasts
on the block that was punched, have 1 that
points all the way up for 3 blocks, and all
the way left. So here's the algo:

Set up left ray casts on ALL blocks, the
upper blocks and the punched block, create
an array **ON** the punched block and return 
the results of teh left raycast to the 
punched block, now we have a huge array
of blocks. We can now shake them, find
2 random blocks in the array, swap em, 
remove em, keep repeating till it's
empty. (NEXT [2])

o TELL PEOPLE HOW THEY CAN DO
DIFFERENT THINGS WITH THE PAINTER (FORMELY
CALLED SPIDER), such as, exploding one ajancent
block (left or right), then deploying which
will give a wierd effect.
