o Implement block falling
system:

	- Make it so if block
	falls on head of player,
	heart is lost.

o Implement heart/lives system:

	- Get an Image for the hearts

	- Anchor in top left with canvas.

o Create the main menu.

o Implement RayGun that
blows up any blocks a straight
line.

o Imp. combo counter on top of dude's
head.

o Add the animations

o Have the objective of the game be to 
get the highest block chain. There are
2 main conditions in this game:

	- Getting the longest block
	chain automatically puts you
	in the lead.

	- But, Ultimately the person
	with the highest score
	wins. You can increase
	your score by getting matches
	and combo's. As for chains,
	they work on a multiplier, 
	of which the formula is:

	(how_many_blocks * .25)^5 = how many points you earn.

	//so for example:
		//16 blocks
		(16 * .25)^5 = 1024;


o Implement power ups coming out after block explosion. - CURRENTLY

o Make meteors fall within a 5 column vacinity.
meaning, 2 left colms from the player, 2 right
colms from the player, and the colm the 
player is in.

Make meterors destroy blocks, potentially 
fucking up combos. - NEXT (1)

o Implement UI, the hearts, the picture
of the Character next to the hearts, 
score in the top right - NEXT (2)


o Make it so you can only
use one assist at a time,
(btw assists are the spiders, 
ray guns, and all that)

o Make it so that the more 
points you earn, the less
real money you must spend.
let's say for the sake 
of simp., for every 1000 points
10 cents is taken off.


o HAVE 3 CHARS in the beginning,
only increase the amount after 
viewership increases.
