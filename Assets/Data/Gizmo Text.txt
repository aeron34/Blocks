In this test, stand over a Block and press space or stand beside 
one and press "J", this is Swapping. If 3 Blocks of a color form a path, 
press "I"(overtop)/"L"(beside) to detonate them, gaining points. 
Path atleast 3 Blocks and detonate them. |Like other puzzle games such as Puyo-Puyo, you can create combos
by detonating a Link, then having a block of a diffent color fall
and complete another Link. Combos yield more points than regular detonations. 
For example 2 independent links is 300 points, 
but a 2x combo....|Links are a central concept to this game, in fact, for links greater 
than 4 blocks in length, the points will be the length
raised to the 5th power. This means a Link of 4 yields 1024 points.|Create a 3X Combo.|PRO TIP: If you haven't finished a distance swap yet, 
pressing "H" will drop the block in front of you. 
Create a 4X Combo.| Create a 8x Link. |That's It! You know how to play!
Both characters have thier own moves and abilities spefic to them. 
Gizmo has grenades, crawlers, and an ultimate swapping technique. 
The box under your health is the weapons box, they're listed in
 the order used above. They're limited so use them wisely. |
